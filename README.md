# Reason Styled System

## Status: WIP

This library is not complete. The API may change. Use at your own risk.

## Motivations

Just for fun.

## Installation

1. Install the library from github:
  ```sh
  npm i github.com:hew/reason-styled-system
  ```

2. Add the library to your `bsconfig.json`:
  ```json
  "bs-dependencies": ["reason-styled-system"],
  ```
